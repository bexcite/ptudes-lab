P(oint) (e)Tudes Lab: Lidar odometry, SLAM and visualization tools
==================================================================

This is a playground of various experiments with SLAM, mapping and visualization
of lidar point clouds. (``Ptudes`` name is an interplay of ``P(oint) (e)Tudes``,
derived from `Etude`_)

.. _Etude: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude

It's heavily using and relying on Ouster sensor lidar data, Ouster SDK, public
datasets that contain Ouster lidar data and lidar odometry poses obtained from
`KISS-ICP`_ package.

Everything in ``ptudes-lab`` package works for multi Python (3.8 - 3.11) and
multi OS (Linux, MacOS, Windows).

Flyby 3d visualizations of lidar data with poses
-------------------------------------------------

Review the registered point cloud map using the per scan poses of the
odometry/slam pipeline with deskewing and point coloring by ``REFLECTIVITY``,
``NEAR_IR``, ``SIGNAL`` and ``RANGE`` channels (channels availability depends on
the UDP Lidar Profile of the data).

Pre-requisite:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Installation
````````````````

You can install ``ptudes-lab`` using Pip from the PyPi
using::

    pip install ptudes-lab

or you can install it in editable mode if you plan to modify the code (or want
to use not yet released features)::

    git clone https://github.com/bexcite/ptudes-lab.git
    cd ptudes-lab
    pip install -e .

NOTE: Don't forget to use `venv` or any other means of controlling the Python
environments, they always save a lot of time later down the road.

1. Get Ouster sensor lidar data in a ``.pcap/.bag`` format
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can download a sample data from the `official sensor docs`_:

Or you can record it from the sensor if you have one, using ``ouster-sdk/cli``::

    ouster-cli source <MY_SENSOR_IP> record

2. Get the lidar scans poses in kitti format
`````````````````````````````````````````````

All my experiments based on `KISS-ICP`_ pose outputs in KITTI format. To get
the scan poses you can run ``kiss-icp`` pipeline on the previously obtained
Ouster ``.pcap`` data using::

    kiss_icp_pipeline --deskew ./OS-0-128_v3.0.1_1024x10.pcap

You can use any pose source with ``--kitti-poses`` in the command ``ptudes
flyby`` below and not necessarily ``KISS-ICP`` output. For example it can be
the result of some post-processing step (smoothing, loop closure, fusion with
other sensors etc) the only requirement is that the number of poses should be
the same as the number of scans in the ``.pcap/.bag`` file.

.. _KISS-ICP: https://github.com/PRBonn/kiss-icp

How to run:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have Ouster sensor ``.pcap/.bag`` data and poses per every scan in
KITTI format you can run ``ptudes flyby`` command as::

    ptudes flyby ./OS-0-128_v3.0.1_1024x10.pcap --kitti-poses ./OS-0-128_v3.0.1_poses_kitti.txt

or for example using ``.bag`` from `Newer College`_ dataset::

    ptudes flyby ./newer-college/2021-ouster-os0-128-alphasense/collection1/2021-07-01-10-37-38-quad-easy.bag \
        --meta ./newer-college/2021-ouster-os0-128-alphasense/beam_intrinsics_os0-128.json \
        --kitti-poses ./2021-07-01-10-37-38-quad-easy_poses_kitti.txt \
        --start-scan 20 \
        --end-scan 50

Use ``--help`` to see more options like ``--start-scan/--end-scan`` to view only
a specific range of scans.

Some useful keyboard shortcuts for ``flyby`` command:

==============  =============================================================
Key             Action
==============  =============================================================
``SPACE``       Stop/Start flying
``>``           Increase/decrease flying speed
``8``           Toggle poses/trajectory view
``k / K``       Cycle point cloud coloring mode of accumulated clouds or map
``g / G``       Cycle point cloud color palette of accumulated clouds or map
``j / J``       Increase/decrease point size of accumulated clouds or map
==============  =============================================================

ROS bags visualizations of raw lidar data
------------------------------------------------------

Ouster sensors produce raw ``lidar_packets/imu_packets`` data in corresponding
ROS topics. To view the point cloud from such raw packets BAGs without spinning a
ROS and installing all drivers one can use ``ptudes viz`` command.

    Not tested with ROS2 bags:(
    
    I wasn't been able to locate the ROS2 bag with raw Ouster ``lidar_packets``,
    so if you by any chance have such a ROS2 bag that you can share with me I
    can make sure that both ROS1 and ROS2 bags working for the ``ptudes viz``
    command. (i.e. ``ptudes.bag.OusterRawBagSource`` packet source can work with
    ROS1/ROS2 bags)

For example to visualize `Newer College` dataset BAGS use::

    ptudes viz ./newer-college/2021-ouster-os0-128-alphasense/collection1/2021-07-01-10-37-38-quad-easy.bag \
        --meta ./newer-college/2021-ouster-os0-128-alphasense/beam_intrinsics_os0-128.json

and it will open:

Since the underlying Viz is the `PointViz`_ shipped with Ouster SDK the full
list of keyboard shortcuts can be found `here`_
